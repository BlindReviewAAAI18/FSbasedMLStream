<P>Multi-label data stream classification is a very challeng-
ing and significant task especially in the handling of high-
dimensional data streams with concept drifts. However, this
challenge has received little attention from the research com-
munity. Therefore, we propose a max-relevance and min-
redundancy based algorithm adaptation approach for the effi-
cient and effective classification on multi-label data streams
with high-dimensional attributes and concept drifts1. In or-
der to reduce the impact from high-dimensional attributes
with noisy attributes, we first refine the minimal-redundancy-
maximal-relevance criterion based on mutual information
to select qualified features. Secondly, we propose the label
and feature distribution based concept drifting detection ap-
proach to distinguish concept drifts hidden in multi-label data
streams. Finally, we build an incremental ensemble classifica-
tion model for efficiently classifying multi-label data streams.
Extensive studies show that our approach can get optimal sub-
sets of features while maintaining a good performance in the
multi-label classification, as compared to several state-of-the-
art multi-label feature selection algorithms using two efficient
multi-label classification methods as base classifiers.</P>
